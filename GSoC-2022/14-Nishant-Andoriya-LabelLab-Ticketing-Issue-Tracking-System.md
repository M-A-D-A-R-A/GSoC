# Project Abstract

LabelLab is an image analysis and classification platform for machine learning (ML) researchers. Originally built to classify images of elephants, it has been developed over the years and is now a full-fledged ML utility tool that is able to classify all kinds of images and carry out a number of ML-related tasks in a project-based manner while teaming up with other researchers. It allows the user to upload images in bulk, label them and use image path tracking feature. Additionally, it supports automatic labeling of a set of unlabeled images by running classification across trained models.

# Work Summary
The codebase architecture involves three components :
1. Backend - RESTful Flask API
2. Frontend - ReactJs application
3. Mobile - Flutter application

For GSoC 2022, the main objectives were to improve the project
management and version tracking system to make it more collaborative. My work spanned mainly across Backend and Mobile App

## Created an Issue Tracking System

- A project member can now create issues within a project.
- An issue must necessarily include a title, description and category.
- These issues can later be updated or deleted by project members.
- The project members can view the list of all issues within a project and filter them based on category, team or a particular entity.
- Worked on creating [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0DMmXmG6OW2JaZgZwGU2DL/LabelLab?node-id=0%3A1) designs for ```issue Detail Screen``` and `Issue Tile` Components
- Comment section improves the project management and make it more collaborative by allowing project members to discuss a particular issue and its updates.

## Flutter CI/CD WorkFlow

Using Github Action, implemented CI/CD flutter workflow that would run on all new PR, every subsequent push to a PR, as well as on the main repo. This would enforce strict quality control and reduce human error, which will be immensely helpful in the long term as we integrate more tests.
